		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Archae_displayName = Dysnomia^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Archae_description = Dysnomia is the small moon of Eris. Not much about Dysnomia is known as its existence only recently came into the category of "things the International Astronomical Union are pretty sure exist." The reason for this is a result of its dark coloration, giving it the rank of "things the International Astronomical Union think are ominous."

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Crokslev_displayName = 10199 Chariklo^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Crokslev_description = Chariklo is the largest known member of the "centaurs," a group of asteroids that wander around the orbits of the outer planets. Not much is known about Chariklo, as most would rather consider Saturn or Uranus for missions, both of which are not far from Crokslev. However, the recent discovery of rings around this object gave it several headlines and now the scientific community is starting to bat an eye towards the large, icy asteroid.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Edas_displayName = 433 Eros^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Edas_description = Eros is a very small, stony, Mars-crossing asteroid. It's been noted as a potential destination for missions robotic that have expended their usefulness at Mars, a midway pitstop on the way to the outer solar system, or as a stopping point in an asteroid-grand-tour.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Ervo_displayName = Eris^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Ervo_description = Eris is the most massive known object beyond the orbit of Neptune. Its discovery and size, comparable to Pluto's, ultimately led to the demotion of Pluto to a dwarf planet. Numerous fight-related injuries are now directly tied to Eris's existence. Eris has a tenuous atmosphere with a heavy concentration of oxygen. There is considerable debate over the origin of this oxygen, whether Eris has life or is simply oversaturated is a question that could only be answered with a visit. The conditions are also suitable for liquid oxygen to exist on the surface, but what are the chances of that?

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Flake_displayName = MK2^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Flake_description = MK2 is a very small moon around Makemake. Despite its small size the moon was discovered on the first major telescope observations of Makemake due to its incredibly high albedo, next to its parent’s rather dim coloring. It is suspected that MK2 is covered in a layer of “fresh powder” but the origins of such powders if they do exist is unknown.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Havous_displayName = Haumea^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Havous_description = Haumea was originally referred to as Pluto's sister. This, however, is no longer the case. Every new discovery relating to Haumea seemed to further make the point clear that Haumea was a very unusual world indeed. From its squished shape, tight rings, and blue patch, Haumea has more recently been called the "trans-Neptunian jewel."

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Kal_displayName = Namaka^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Kal_description = Namaka is a lumpy little moon that hangs out near the rings of Haumea. The bright rings, and equally bright Haumea, made it difficult to spot the small moon. Never the less, Namaka was discovered and given a very important almost-footnote in the morning newspaper.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Ki'Ki_displayName = Hi'iaka^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Ki'Ki_description = Hi'iaka was the first moon known to orbit Haumea, its orbit seems to suggest it was captured. There is debate in the planetary science community on the nature of Hi'iaka's origin. Some say Ki'Ki formed from the rings of Haumea and migrated outwards, however the more widely accepted answer is that Hi'iaka was once a comet. If Hi'iaka is an ex-comet, it should be signifantly easier to chase down than the others; although, it's not exactly nearby.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Mracksis_displayName = Makemake^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Mracksis_description = Makemake is a very red dwarf planet living around the same region of space as Haumea. The vibrant red coloration is the result of tholins building up on the surface. The reason why Makemake possesses such a high global concentration of tholins, while objects like Pluto or Haumea do not, is a mystery. Unfortunately Makemake does not get the same amount of attention as other objects beyond Neptune, missions to this region take years to travel, perhaps now is the time to finally send a visitor?

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Soden_displayName = Sedna^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Soden_description = Sedna marks the boldest ambitions of Earth's space programs. It's the furthest frontier that could ever be hoped to reach with current technologies, and it's not going to stick around for long. The small, lonely dwarf floats out beyond even Eris. It's said that from this distant vantage point, Earth is a pale blue dot.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Zore_displayName = 16 Psyche^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Zore_description = Psyche is one of the most massive objects in the main asteroid belt. Psyche's small size and high mass has lead to the conclusion that Psyche is mostly made of metal, making it the largest metallic asteroid known in the entire system. It's been concluded that Psyche may be the core of a protoplanet that was shattered early in the solar system's history. Though scientists can only speculate what that young planet Psyche came from may have been like, most agree it's a shame that they can't identify the other parts of it.
